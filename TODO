Manual review
=============

We'll manually review the output of debcargo and based on this, add things to
"Bugs" and "Vital features" below.

Reviewed so far:

debcargo cargo clap chrono error-chain flate2 itertools regex semver
semver-parser tar tempdir walkdir ansi_term subprocess


Bugs
====

P: rust-regex-0.2 source: duplicate-in-relation-field in librust-regex-0.2+simd-accel-dev depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}

I: rust-regex-0.2 source: duplicate-short-description librust-regex-0.2-dev librust-regex-0.2+simd-accel-dev
I: rust-regex-0.2 source: duplicate-long-description librust-regex-0.2-dev librust-regex-0.2+simd-accel-dev
"Feature" packages should mention this in their package description

Comment: paragraphs in d/copyright should have FIXME for easy grepping

If there are no FIXMEs emitted, debcargo's output should not prompt the user to
"Please update the sections marked FIXME"


Vital features
==============

Overrides
---------

Add a command-line flag to supply an override file. When read, it should supply
override values for:

d/copyright
```````````

In the "Files:" stanza, we autodetect the value, and output a comment.
The value could be overridden and the comment suppressed.

In each "Files:" stanza, sometimes we output "License: UNKNOWN; FIXME" plus a comment.
The License could be overridden and the comment suppressed.

If the autodetected value differs from the overridden value, debcargo should
emit an "info" notice on stdout. This helps when upgrading, in case any files
had new people added as part of their copyright, etc.

d/control
`````````

P: rust-subprocess-0.1 source: no-homepage-field
Sometimes we can't detect the Homepage, but the maintainer could supply a
manual one.
