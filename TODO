Manual review
=============

We'll manually review the output of debcargo and based on this, add things to
"Bugs" and "Vital features" below.

Reviewed (only lintian, not manually) so far:

advapi32-sys ansi_term bufstream cargo chrono clap crates-io crossbeam curl
debcargo docopt env_logger error-chain filetime flate2 fs2 git2 git2-curl glob
hamcrest itertools kernel32-sys libc libgit2-sys log miow num_cpus openssl
psapi-sys regex rustc-serialize semver semver-parser serde serde_derive
serde_ignored serde_json shell-escape subprocess tar tempdir term toml url
walkdir winapi

i.e. debcargo-CURRENT, cargo-0.19, and their dependencies

Bugs
====

libgit2-sys:
Unrepresentable dependency version predicate: libz-sys Predicate { op: GtEq, major: 0, minor: None, patch: None, pre: [] }
psapi-sys:
Unrepresentable dependency version predicate: winapi Predicate { op: Wildcard(Major), major: 0, minor: None, patch: None, pre: [] }


Vital features
==============

Overrides
---------

Add a command-line flag to supply an override file. When read, it should supply
override values for:

d/copyright
```````````

In the "Files:" stanza, we autodetect the value, and output a comment.
The value could be overridden and the comment suppressed.

In each "Files:" stanza, sometimes we output "License: UNKNOWN; FIXME" plus a comment.
The License could be overridden and the comment suppressed.

If the autodetected value differs from the overridden value, debcargo should
emit an "info" notice on stdout. This helps when upgrading, in case any files
had new people added as part of their copyright, etc.

If an override-value is given for a "Files:" stanza that doesn't exist,
debcargo should emit a warning.

d/control
`````````

P: rust-subprocess-0.1 source: no-homepage-field
Sometimes we can't detect the Homepage, but the maintainer could supply a
manual one.


Nice to have
============

Collapse auto-generated Files stanzas
-------------------------------------

e.g. for rust-url:

~~~~
Files: ./src/quirks.rs
Copyright:  2016 The rust-url developers.
License: UNKNOWN; FIXME
Comment: [..]

Files: ./src/parser.rs
Copyright:  2013-2016 The rust-url developers.
License: UNKNOWN; FIXME
Comment: [..]

Files: ./src/lib.rs
Copyright:  2013-2015 The rust-url developers.
License: UNKNOWN; FIXME
Comment: [..]

[..]
~~~~

would be good to collapse all of these down into a single "Files" stanza and
combine the dates into a single range. This would be a bit fiddly
